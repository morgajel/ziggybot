Ziggy isn't the brightest bot, but here's a simple configuration of him.
I'm going to include the dribbly personality file, because, well ziggy has his secrets.

dribbly's is much more managable.
simply copy dribbly.xml to config.xml and he'll be good to go.


There's still a lot of ziggy-hardcoded stuff that needs to be changed:
- registration email
- "magic cueball"
etc.


To become an administrator of the bot, run ziggy.pl with the dribbly.xml
foo@home $ ./ziggy.pl dribbly.xml
register a user by messaging the bot "register username emailaddress"
emailaddress has to be a valid email. The bot will email you a password
Once you receive this password, a users.xml file will be generated in the
bot's "home directory." you'll see an entry for your user. Simply add "admin="1"

 <user name="morgajel" email="irc@morgajel.com" pass="e16b2ab8d12314bf4efbd6203906ea6c" />
becomes
 <user name="morgajel" admin="1" email="irc@morgajel.com" pass="e16b2ab8d12314bf4efbd6203906ea6c" />


TODO
- remove all ziggy-coded sayings from code.
